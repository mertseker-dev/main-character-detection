## Getting Started
The code requires the following libraries to be installed:

-  python 3.8
-  tensorflow 2.3.1
-  opencv 4.4.0.44
-  numpy 1.18.5

The code requires OpenPose to be installed. Refer to https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose for installation instructions. After installation, download the  script main_character_detection.py from this page. Finally, the project folder should look like:

```sh

## Main Character Detection

In order to run the code on a folder containing one or more images, run the following command:

### Usage

```sh
$ python main_character_detection.py -r=[PATH_TO_IMAGES, WRITE_PATH]
```
- PATH_TO_IMAGES (mandatory): Path to the folder that contains the images to be evaluated. The path should be in the following example format: 'C:&#92;&#92;Users&#92;&#92;user&#92;&#92;Documents&#92;&#92;examples&#92;&#92;'. Use '&#92;&#92;' in between the directories and also use '&#92;&#92;' at the end.
- WRITE_PATH (optional): Path to the folder that will contain the output images. The output images will have rectangles on the detected faces. Predicted main characters will have a green facial rectangle and the rest will have red facial rectangles. Use the same format as PATH_TO_IMAGES.

### Output format
The outputs of the evaluation will automatically be written in a csv. file with a unique timestamp name under the folder "outputs". The naming format of the files are: "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv". The output file contains the following information for each image: filename, [top left X pixel location of the main character's facial rectangle, top left Y pixel location of the main character's facial rectangle, bottom right X pixel location of the main character's facial rectangle, bottom right Y pixel location of the main character's facial rectangle]. In case there are multiple detected main characters, there will be multiple rows with the same filename where each row will contain the location of a different main character.

## Results

We collected 300 images with a wide variety from the internet. The main characters were annotated by a professional photojournalist for all of the images. Our method was able to produce a 0.83 F1-score for main character detection on this dataset.

## Example Outputs

You can see example outputs below.
